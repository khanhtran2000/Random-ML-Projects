## Random Projects

In these small self-created projects, I try to implement my knowlegde in Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. The projects are very simple to perceive as my knowledge is still limited so they act as my self-made practice assignments. More projects will be introduced in the future aligning with my learning progress.
