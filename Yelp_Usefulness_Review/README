- It takes really long to run the script since most of the codes are loops. But it runs eventually. I think it may take around 30 minutes. 

- There is a function in Python that runs k-fold cross-validation faster than loops but it automatically split the file, and in this script I want to keep the professor's way of splitting files so I use loops.

- I got 5 errors when run 30-fold cross-validation. To put it in simple words, I have a 25-fold instead of 30. This I still can't figure out the why I got those errors. 

- This is not the best version in terms of code style and efficiency, and certainly I think it won't produce the same result as your code since I got 25-fold instead of 30. But to some extent, it follows the steps of your instructions and code and works out. 

- The research paper was attached with the script, so it can be viewed along side with the script for better understanding.
